# unet_briansegmentation
This repository implements U-Net in PyTorch for FLAIR abnormality segmentation on brain MRI scans using the BraTS 2020 dataset. It includes pre-trained weights for inference and training, with easy Docker setup. Check out the live demo hosted on huggingface at arithescientist.com/unetidiagnosis to explore the model in action.
